short_description: Retrieves a Range
description:
    - Retrieves information about existing Ranges.
    - A Range object represents a set of contiguous IP addresses in the same IP space with no gap.
    - They are expressed as a (start, end) pair within a given subnet that are grouped together for administrative purpose and protocol management.
    - The start and end values are not required to align with CIDR boundaries.
